# Recurrence Plot
[Recurrence Plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_plot) â€“ A recurrence plot (RP) is an advanced technique of **nonlinear** data analysis. It is a visualisation (or a graph) of a square matrix, in which the matrix elements correspond to those times at which a state of a dynamical system recurs (columns and rows correspond then to a certain pair of times).
